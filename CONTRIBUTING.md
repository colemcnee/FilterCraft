# Contributing to FilterCraft

Thank you for your interest in contributing to FilterCraft! This document outlines the process for contributing to our professional photo editing application.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **macOS 13.0+** for development
- **Xcode 15.0+** with iOS 16.0+ and macOS 12.0+ SDKs  
- **Homebrew** for managing development tools
- **Git** with proper SSH key setup for GitHub

### Initial Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:yourusername/filtercraft.git
   cd filtercraft
   ```
3. **Run the setup script**:
   ```bash
   ./Scripts/setup.sh
   ```
4. **Verify your setup**:
   ```bash
   ./Scripts/test.sh && ./Scripts/lint.sh
   ```

## üéØ How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- **üêõ Bug fixes**: Fix issues in existing functionality
- **‚ú® New features**: Add new filters, effects, or capabilities
- **üìö Documentation**: Improve docs, comments, or examples
- **üé® UI/UX improvements**: Enhance user interface and experience
- **‚ö° Performance optimizations**: Make the app faster or more efficient
- **üß™ Tests**: Add or improve test coverage
- **üîß Developer experience**: Improve build tools, CI/CD, or development workflow

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to see if your contribution is already being worked on
2. **Create an issue** for new features or significant changes to discuss approach
3. **Comment on issues** you'd like to work on to avoid duplicate efforts

## üìù Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

Always work on a feature branch, never directly on `main`:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
# or  
git checkout -b docs/documentation-update
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

Follow these guidelines while developing:

#### Code Style
- Use **SwiftLint** for code formatting (run `./Scripts/lint.sh --fix`)
- Follow **existing patterns** and architecture decisions
- Write **clear, descriptive names** for variables and functions
- Add **documentation** for public APIs
- Keep **functions small** and focused (< 50 lines)

#### Architecture Guidelines
- **Separate concerns**: Keep UI, business logic, and data layers distinct
- **Use dependency injection**: Make components testable
- **Follow MVVM patterns**: ViewModels for complex UI logic
- **Leverage Swift features**: Use optionals, enums, and generics appropriately

#### Testing
- **Write tests** for new functionality
- **Update existing tests** when changing behavior  
- **Test on both platforms** (iOS and macOS)
- **Include edge cases** and error conditions

### 3. Test Your Changes

Run the full test suite before committing:

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
./Scripts/test.sh --coverage

# Run code quality checks
./Scripts/lint.sh --strict

# Test builds on both platforms
./Scripts/build.sh --release
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new vintage filter effect"
```

#### Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(ios): add new blur filter with intensity control
fix(macos): resolve memory leak in image processing
docs: update installation instructions
test(core): add unit tests for filter application
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:

- **Clear title** using conventional commit format
- **Detailed description** of changes made
- **Screenshots or demos** for UI changes
- **Testing instructions** for reviewers
- **Breaking changes** clearly noted (if any)

### Review Process

1. **Automated checks** must pass (CI, tests, linting)
2. **Code review** by at least one maintainer
3. **Testing verification** by reviewer when needed
4. **Approval and merge** by maintainer

### Review Criteria

### Writing Good Tests

```swift
func testVintageFilterAppliesCorrectAdjustments() {
    // Arrange
    let editSession = EditSession()
    let testImage = createTestImage()
    
    // Act
    editSession.loadImage(testImage)
    editSession.applyFilter(.vintage, intensity: 1.0)
    
    // Assert
    XCTAssertNotNil(editSession.previewImage)
    XCTAssertEqual(editSession.baseAdjustments.saturation, -0.2, accuracy: 0.01)
    XCTAssertEqual(editSession.baseAdjustments.warmth, 0.3, accuracy: 0.01)
}
```

## üìö Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

Use Swift's documentation comments:

```swift
/// Applies a filter to the current image with specified intensity.
/// 
/// - Parameters:
///   - filterType: The type of filter to apply
///   - intensity: The intensity of the effect (0.0 to 1.0)
/// - Returns: True if the filter was applied successfully
public func applyFilter(_ filterType: FilterType, intensity: Float) -> Bool {
    // Implementation
}
```
